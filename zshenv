# This file, .zshenv, is the first file sourced by zsh for EACH shell, whether

# This includes non-interactive sub-shells!
# So, put as little in this file as possible, to avoid performance impact.

# Tell zsh where to look for our dotfiles.

#source $HOME/.zshrc

# By default, Zsh will look for dotfiles in $HOME (and find this file), but
# once $ZDOTDIR is defined, it will start looking in that dir instead.

# ${X:=Y} specifies a default value Y to use for parameter X, if X has not been
# set or is null. This will actually create X, if necessary, and assign the
# value to it.
# To simply return a default value *without* setting X, use ${X:-Y}
